## JsonQuery.co.uk

Born out of a need to query large arrays of JSON data, I created jsonquery because I couldn't find any existing simple and free tools up to the job. Essentially its a user interface to the typical SQL type commands you would use to really dig down into your data.

After the data is supplied you are taken into an interactive interface containing controls for filters, grouping, sorting and various display options including charts. Only intending for it to be a small, quick side project to begin with, it quickly grew into something that a lot colleagues starting using, suggesting improvements and new features. It is now fully baked in to an internal reporting system and seen as a valuable business intelligence tool.

Underneath it is a static-site generated and built using a webpack build step and hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is quickly becoming my method of choice for smaller projects.
