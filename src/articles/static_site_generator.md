## Static Site Generator

This project came about firstly out of frustration of watching freelance web developers friends battle with inflexible content management systems to build out sites for clients. I thought could I use my experience in building tooling and web apps to help out here. I must say now that this is an unfinished project (one of the very few), but with the work I did put into it, I still reckon it has some legs.

It basically sits in between a self-hosted content management system and a cloud-based drag and drop website builder and is aimed at the casual web developer who knows how to deal with HTML, JavaScript & CSS but not so much the databases and data. Ive used both and know that if you want actual total control of everything they dont quite cut it.

In my system the user will build all of the templates offline, away from any distrations and limitations, just adding in placeholders for any parts that need to be managed like content and images. They would then upload their scaffolding to the (cloud-based) system, and using a manifest they supply, it would generate all of the controls needed to supply the data for the templates. Then once they are happy with all of the data theyve put in, a simple publish button would then merge the templates and content and deploy it a location of their choice.

When I last looked, something similar didnt exist, so I dont know whether its because its a rubbish idea or something that could go somewhere. Built with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with Node on the backend, its a project that I could easily pick up again when I next get a chunk of time. If you would like to see the code, get in touch!
