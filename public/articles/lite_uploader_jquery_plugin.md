## Lite Uploader

This is a small nodeJS library and jQuery plugin which utilises the newer HTML5 and Javascript features [File API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles), [XHR2](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2) and [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) to make uploading files a doddle. Features include basic validation, hooks for all major events like progress, success, fail etc, and drag/drop support and is a good choice for any developer who is not so worried about supporting legacy browsers.

Created in 2013, it has gone through many versions and revisions and since open-sourcing it on Github and making it available on bower and npm, it has a gained a small user-base who contribute back to the project by raising issues and creating pull requests. It has a full suite of unit tests, providing a high code coverage keeping regressions to a mimimum.
