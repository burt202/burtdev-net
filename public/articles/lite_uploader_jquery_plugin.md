## Lite Uploader jQuery Plugin

This is a small jQuery plugin (featured in this [jQuery plugin top 10](http://tekbrand.com/jquery/10-best-jquery-file-upload-plugins)) which utilises the HTML5 features [File API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles) and [XHR2](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2)) to make uploading files a doddle. The aim was to see, at its absolute minimum, how little code do you need to make a small, but very usable and easily expandable jQuery upload plugin. With some useful options including basic validation it turns out not many. After minification it is very small in size and is a good choice for any developer who is not so worried about supporting legacy browsers.

Since releasing v2, I have noticed an increase in interest in the plugin, from issues being raised to suggestions for features. This prompted me to focus on making the plugin as stable as I could, so it now has a full suite of Jasmine tests that provide high coverage.
